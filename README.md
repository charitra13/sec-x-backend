- **Advanced Blog Features**:
    - Automatic `slug` generation for SEO-friendly URLs.
    - Calculation of estimated `readingTime`.
    - Tracking for `views`, `likes`, and `shares`.
    - Support for `draft` and `published` statuses.
    - SEO metadata fields.
- **Image Uploads**: Integrated with Cloudinary for efficient image hosting and transformations.

## üõ°Ô∏è CORS Security Implementation (Phase 3 - Production Hardening)

### Overview
This project implements enterprise-level CORS security with production hardening features:

### Key Features Implemented:

#### 1. **Smart Rate Limiting**
- **OPTIONS-specific rate limiting**: 20 preflight requests per 5 minutes per IP
- **Suspicious origin rate limiting**: 3 requests per 15 minutes for blocked origins
- **Adaptive rate limiting**: Different limits based on request characteristics

#### 2. **Origin Whitelist Management**
- **Dynamic origin management**: Add/remove origins via API
- **Environment-based filtering**: Separate origins for dev/staging/production
- **Usage tracking**: Monitor origin usage patterns
- **Admin-only access**: Secure origin management endpoints

#### 3. **CORS Policy Documentation**
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Complete CORS policy guide
- **Schema validation**: JSON schema for CORS configuration
- **Troubleshooting guides**: Common issues and solutions
- **Best practices**: Security recommendations

### API Endpoints Added:

#### Origin Management (Admin Only)
- `GET /api/admin/origins` - List all managed origins
- `POST /api/admin/origins` - Add new origin
- `PUT /api/admin/origins/:originId` - Update origin
- `DELETE /api/admin/origins/:originId` - Remove origin

#### CORS Documentation
- `GET /api/cors/docs` - Complete CORS policy documentation
- `GET /api/cors/schema` - CORS configuration schema

#### CORS Debugging
- `GET /api/cors-debug/status` - Check current CORS configuration

- `POST /api/cors-debug/test-origin` - Test origin allowance (admin)

### Validation Scripts
```bash
# Validate CORS configuration
npm run validate:cors

# Pre-deployment validation
npm run pre-deploy
```

### Security Features:
- ‚úÖ **No wildcard origins** - Only specific domains allowed
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS enforcement** - Production origins must use HTTPS
- ‚úÖ **Origin validation** - Every request validated
- ‚úÖ **Suspicious pattern detection** - Monitors and logs suspicious origins
- ‚úÖ **Rate limiting** - Prevents CORS abuse
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging** - Detailed CORS violation tracking
- ‚úÖ **Admin controls** - Secure origin management
- ‚úÖ **Documentation** - Complete policy and troubleshooting guides

### SSL Certificate Generation
```bash
npm run generate-certs
```
This command generates self-signed SSL certificates for localhost development.

### HTTPS Development Server
```bash
npm run dev:https
```
Starts the development server with HTTPS support using the generated certificates.

### CORS Configuration
The application includes enhanced CORS configuration that supports:
- Dynamic origin validation
- Development and production environments
- Detailed CORS violation logging
- Support for localhost HTTPS development

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - HTTP development server
- `npm run dev:https` - HTTPS development server

### v1.1.1 (2024-07-13)

- **Fix**: Resolved TypeScript compilation error TS6192 that was causing Render deployment failures.
- **Cleanup**: Removed unused validation schema imports from `blog.controller.ts` - these schemas are correctly used in the routes layer for request validation, not in controllers.
- **Architecture**: Confirmed proper separation of concerns - validation happens at route level, business logic in controllers.

### v1.0.2 (2024-07-14)

- **Feat**: Updated CORS configuration to allow requests from the frontend application hosted at `https://sec-x.vercel.app`.

### v1.0.1 (2024-07-13)

- **Fix**: Adjusted the `start` script in `package.json` to correct the path for the compiled entry point, resolving a deployment failure on Render. The execution environment on Render was starting from the `src` directory, and the script now accounts for this.

### v1.0.2 (2024-07-13)

- **Fix**: Made the `start` script more robust by chaining the `build` command. It now runs `npm run build` before `node dist/index.js` to ensure the compiled code is always present in the runtime environment on Render.

### v1.1.0 (2024-07-13)

- **Refactor**: Resolved multiple TypeScript and linting errors across the codebase.
- **Fix**: Corrected a module import path in `blog.controller.ts`.
- **Cleanup**: Removed numerous unused variables and imports from controllers and routes to improve code quality.
